# DoubleData: a friend-finder for developers for pair programming

DoubleData is a survey-based match maker for a developer to find another whose interests are closely related.

I did not want to have this be a match-maker app because the algorithm was to find a match whose answers were the closest. I cannot find a couple in my mind who are similar. Differences are good. When are similarities ideal? Finding someone to learn programming with. 

DoubleData uses a survey and some basic questions about the user's practices, interests, and attitudes to find a match. The images of the ideal developers are image links. I try to update them as various sites remove them.
